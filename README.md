   I created a repository named `DonTests` and uploaded the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files by dragging and dropping them into the repository.

2. **Set Up GitHub Pages**  
   To host the website, I navigated to the repository's settings. Under the "Code and Automation" section, I clicked on the "Pages" option.

3. **Configure the Source**

   - I selected "Deploy from a branch" as the source.
   - Then, I chose the `main` branch.
