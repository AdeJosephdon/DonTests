# DonTests

This repository contains the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the DonTests project.

## Hosting on GitHub Pages

To host the DonTests website on GitHub Pages, follow the steps below:

1. **Create a Repository**  
   I created a repository named `DonTests` and uploaded the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files by dragging and dropping them into the repository.

2. **Set Up GitHub Pages**  
   To host the website, I navigated to the repository's settings. Under the "Code and Automation" section, I clicked on the "Pages" option.

3. **Configure the Source**  
   - I selected "Deploy from a branch" as the source.
   - Then, I chose the `main` branch.
   - Since the code was not in any subdirectory, I selected the root directory.

4. **Save and Deploy**  
   I clicked "Save" to apply the GitHub Pages source settings changes. After the deployment process was complete, I went back to the "Pages" section in settings to find the website link.

## Access the Website

Once deployed, the DonTests website is accessible via the link provided in the "Pages" section of the repository settings.
